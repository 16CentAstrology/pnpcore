# PnP Core Tools

To create and maintain the PnP Core SDK additional tools are created and these live in this folder. Following tools are available:

Tool | Description
-----|------------
PnP.Core.DomainModelGenerator | Tool that helps with the (initial) model generation
CodeCoverage | A folder with the PowerShell script to run test coverage report for a specific test project (e.g. `PnP.Core.Test`) or an individual test file (e.g. `PnP.Core.Test\SharePoint\FilesTests.cs`). Refer to [Writing test](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/contributing/writing%20tests.html) for details.
