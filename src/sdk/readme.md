# PnP Core SDK source

The PnP Core SDK consists out of one solution named `PnP.Core.sln` which has two projects:

- `PnP.Core`: this is the actual SDK code base project
- `PnP.Core.Test`: project containing the SDK tests

If you want to contribute to this SDK check-out our [contributor guidance](../../docs/index.md).
