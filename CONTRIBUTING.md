# Contribution guidelines

We appreciate that you're interested in helping with moving the project forward. Before you submit your first PR, please read the following guide. We'd hate to see you work on something that someone else is already working on, something that we agreed not to do or something that doesn't match the project.

Sharing is caring!

## You have an idea for a new feature

Awesome! Good ideas are invaluable for every product. Before you start hacking away, please check if there is no similar idea already listed in the [issue list](https://github.com/pnp/pnpcore/issues). If not, please create a new issue describing your idea. Once we agree on the feature scope and architecture, the feature will be ready for building. Don't hesitate to mention in the issue if you'd like to build the feature yourself. If it's the first time you're contributing to the PnP Core SDK checkout the [contributor guide](https://pnp.github.io/pnpcore/articles/contributor/readme.html) to get started.

## You have a suggestion for improving an existing feature

Nothing is perfect. If you have an idea how to improve, let us know by submitting an issue in the [issue list](https://github.com/pnp/pnpcore/issues). Some things are done for a reason, but some are not. Let's discuss what you think and see how the project could be improved for everyone.

## You've found a bug

Bugs happen. When you find a bug, please have a look at the [issue list](https://github.com/pnp/pnpcore/issues) if a similar bug has already been logged. If not, let us know what doesn't work and how we can reproduce it. If we can't reproduce your bug, we will ask you for clarification, which will only make it longer to fix it.

## Fixing typos

Typos are embarrassing! Most PR's that fix typos will be accepted immediately. In order to make it easier to review the PR, please narrow the focus instead of sending a huge PR of fixes.
