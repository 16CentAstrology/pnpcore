# PnP Core SDK - preview

The PnP Core SDK is an SDK designed to work against Microsoft 365. It provides a unified object model for working with SharePoint Online and the broader Microsoft 365 environment. Currently the library is an **early preview** in which the focus was on coding the basics so that in a next step the actual extending of the library can go smooth. The initial goal for this library will be to cover the needs of developers working with either SharePoint Online or Teams, but obviously we're also open to extend this library further towards other Microsoft 365 components such as Planner, Yammer, Mail, etc.

More details on how to use this library and how to contribute can be found in our [documentation folder](docs/index.md).
